- Implement Water Jug Problem in Prolog,
    - ### Variation1:
      A Water Jug Problem: You are given two jugs, a 4-gallon one and a 3-gallon one, a pump which has unlimited water which you can use to fill the jug, and the ground on which water may be poured. Neither jug has any measuring markings on it. How can you get exactly 2 gallons of water in the 4-gallon jug?
    - ### Variation2:
      You've got to defuse a bomb by placing exactly 4 gallons (15 L) of water on a sensor. The problem is, you only have a 5 gallon (18.9 L) jug and a 3 gallons (11 L) jug on hand! Neither jug has any measuring markings on it.
    - ### Variation3:
      A milkman carries a full 12 litre container of milk. He needs to deliver exactly 6 litres. But the customer only has 8 and 5 litre jugs. Neither jug has any measuring
markings on it.

- Implement Missionaries and Cannibals Problem Solution in Prolog Missionaries and Cannibals is a problem in which 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals want to cross from the left bank of a river to the right bank of the river. There is a boat on the left bank, but it only carries at most two people at a time (and can never cross with zero people). If cannibals ever outnumber missionaries on either bank, the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
